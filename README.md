# Local Athens Clojure Sandbox

Opinion: _you should have a Clojure Sandbox for learning Clojure_.

Base it on this project, or use something else. Put new stuff you learn in it.

Always run code to verify your understanding.

_How to use this sandbox_

1. Install the [Clojure CLI][1]
2. Install Visual Studio Code with Calva
3. Connect to a REPL in Calva ("Jack in")
4. Open `src/athens/sandbox.clj` and run one expression at a time: `(ns ,,,)`,
   then `(defn ...)`, and so on.
   - (this is exactly what the Clojure interpreter does when it runs your
     program "for real")

Using tools other than Calva is perfectly fine. I'm choosing to recommend _one_
tool here for clarity.
